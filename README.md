# Swival

A coding agent for any model. [Documentation](https://swival.dev/)

Swival is a CLI coding agent built to be practical, reliable, and easy to use.
It works with frontier models, but its main goal is to be as reliable as
possible with smaller models, including local ones. It is designed from the
ground up to handle tight context windows and limited resources without falling
apart.

It connects to [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/),
[HuggingFace Inference API](https://huggingface.co/inference-api), or
[OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/), sends your task, and runs an autonomous
tool loop until it produces an answer. With LM Studio it auto-discovers your
loaded model, so there's nothing to configure. A few thousand lines of Python,
no framework.

## Quickstart

### LM Studio

1. Install [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) and load a model with tool-calling
   support. Recommended first model:
   [qwen3-coder-next](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3-Coder-Next-GGUF)
   (great quality/speed tradeoff on local hardware).
   Crank the context size as high as your hardware allows.
2. Start the LM Studio server.
3. Install Swival:

```sh
uv tool install swival
```

4. Run:

```sh
swival "Refactor the error handling in src/api.py"
```

That's it. Swival finds the model, connects, and goes to work.

### HuggingFace

```sh
export HF_TOKEN=hf_...
uv tool install swival
swival "Refactor the error handling in src/api.py" \
    --provider huggingface --model zai-org/GLM-5
```

You can also point it at a dedicated endpoint with `--base-url` and `--api-key`.

### OpenRouter

```sh
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk_or_...
uv tool install swival
swival "Refactor the error handling in src/api.py" \
    --provider openrouter --model z-ai/glm-5
```

### Interactive sessions

```sh
swival --repl
```

The REPL carries conversation history across questions, which makes it good for
exploratory work and longer tasks.

### Updates and uninstall

```sh
uv tool upgrade swival    # update
uv tool uninstall swival  # remove
```

## What makes it different

**Reliable with small models.** Context management is one of Swival's strengths.
It keeps things clean and focused, which is especially important when you are
working with models that have tight context windows. Graduated compaction,
persistent thinking notes, and a todo checklist all survive context resets, so
the agent doesn't lose track of multi-step plans even under pressure.

**Your models, your way.** Works with LM Studio, HuggingFace Inference API,
and OpenRouter. With LM Studio, it auto-discovers whatever model you have
loaded. With HuggingFace or OpenRouter, point it at any supported model. You
pick the model and the infrastructure.

**Review loop and LLM-as-a-judge.** Swival has a configurable review loop that
can run external reviewer scripts or use a built-in LLM-as-judge to
automatically evaluate and retry agent output. Good for quality assurance on
tasks that matter.

**Built for benchmarking.** Pass `--report report.json` and Swival writes a
machine-readable evaluation report with per-call LLM timing, tool
success/failure counts, context compaction events, and guardrail interventions.
Useful for comparing models, settings, skills, and MCP servers systematically
on real coding tasks.

**Skills and MCP.** Extend the agent with SKILL.md-based skills for reusable
workflows, and connect to external tools via the Model Context Protocol.

**Small enough to read and hack.** A few thousand lines of Python across a
handful of files, with no framework underneath. Read the whole agent in an
afternoon. If something doesn't work the way you want, change it.

**CLI-native.** stdout is exclusively the final answer. All diagnostics go to
stderr. Pipe Swival's output straight into another command or a file.
