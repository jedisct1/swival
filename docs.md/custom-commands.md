# Custom Commands

Custom commands let you run external scripts from the REPL and feed their output into the conversation. Type `!name` and Swival looks up an executable called `name` in your commands directory, runs it, and injects its stdout as the next user message.

## Setup

Create the commands directory and add executable scripts:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/swival/commands
```

If you set `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, the directory is `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/swival/commands` instead.

Each file in this directory is a command. The file must be executable and its name must contain only letters, digits, hyphens, and underscores.

```sh
cat > ~/.config/swival/commands/context <<'EOF'
#!/bin/sh
base_dir="$1"
cd "$base_dir"
echo "## Git status"
git status --short
echo "## Recent commits"
git log --oneline -5
EOF
chmod +x ~/.config/swival/commands/context
```

## Usage

In the REPL, prefix the command name with `!`:

```text
swival> !context
```

This runs the `context` script and sends its stdout to the model as if you had typed it. Additional arguments are passed through:

```text
swival> !context --all
```

Quoted arguments are handled correctly:

```text
swival> !deploy "staging environment" --dry-run
```

## How Commands Are Called

The command receives `base_dir` (the project root) as its first positional argument, followed by any arguments from the REPL line. The working directory is also set to `base_dir`. This matches the convention used by reviewer scripts.

```text
$COMMANDS_DIR/name $base_dir [args...]
```

## Environment Variables

Commands inherit the parent environment. Swival also sets:

| Variable       | Description                                                            |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SWIVAL_MODEL` | The resolved model identifier for the current session (when available) |

## Output Handling

The command's stdout is stripped and injected as a user message. If the output is too large for the remaining context window, it is truncated to fit. When the context window size is unknown, a hard cap of 100KB applies.

The command's stderr is printed to the terminal on success. On failure (non-zero exit), Swival prints a single error message using stderr, stdout, or the exit code (in that priority order) and does not inject anything into the conversation.

## Timeouts

Commands have a 30-second timeout. If the command does not finish in time, Swival prints a timeout error and skips the injection.

## Edge Cases

- `!` alone or `! foo` (space after `!`) are treated as regular input, not commands
- Names containing `/`, `..`, spaces, or special characters are rejected
- If the commands directory does not exist, Swival prints a hint and skips
- If the command is not found or not executable, Swival prints an error and skips
- Empty output (stdout is blank after stripping) is skipped with a note
- If a bad shebang or missing interpreter prevents the command from starting, Swival catches the error and continues

## History

Custom command output is logged to `.swival/HISTORY.md` with the label `[!name] !name [args...]` so you can distinguish command-driven turns from typed input.
