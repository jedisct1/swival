# Safety and Sandboxing

Swival's built-in sandbox is implemented at the application layer. It validates paths and enforces command policy in Python, but it is not an operating-system isolation boundary. You should treat it as a strong guardrail for normal use, not as a hard security perimeter against untrusted or adversarial models.

If you need stronger isolation, Swival has a built-in AgentFS integration that enforces filesystem boundaries at the OS level.

## AgentFS Sandbox Mode

Pass `--sandbox agentfs` to run Swival inside an AgentFS overlay. At startup, Swival re-executes itself inside `agentfs run`, which provides copy-on-write filesystem isolation. The agent can edit files and run commands freely, but writes are confined to the overlay — your real project tree stays untouched until you copy changes back.

```sh
swival --sandbox agentfs "Refactor the auth module" --yolo
```

In this mode, `--base-dir` and each `--add-dir` path are mapped to AgentFS `--allow` rules so the agent can write to those directories inside the overlay. Everything else on the host filesystem is read-only to subprocesses.

Swival automatically generates a deterministic session ID from the project directory, so re-running `swival --sandbox agentfs` in the same directory reuses the overlay. You can see the session ID and a resume command when diagnostics are enabled (the default unless `--quiet` is set). To provide your own session ID instead:

```sh
swival --sandbox agentfs --sandbox-session my-feature "Continue the refactor" --yolo
```

To get a fresh, ephemeral overlay with no session reuse:

```sh
swival --sandbox agentfs --no-sandbox-auto-session "One-off task" --yolo
```

After a run, Swival prints a diff hint showing how to review changes (unless `--quiet` is set):

```
  Review changes: agentfs diff swival-a1b2c3d4e5f6
```

This requires the `agentfs` binary on PATH. If it is not found, Swival exits with an actionable error. See [Using Swival With AgentFS](agentfs.md) for more workflows.

### Strict Read Mode

By default, the AgentFS sandbox only isolates writes — the agent can still read any file on the host filesystem. Pass `--sandbox-strict-read` to also restrict reads to explicitly allowed directories:

```sh
swival --sandbox agentfs --sandbox-strict-read "Analyze the project" --yolo
```

This flag requires an AgentFS version that supports strict read isolation. No current release supports it yet, so using the flag today produces a clear error with the installed version. When AgentFS ships the feature, Swival will detect it automatically and pass the appropriate flags through.

You can also combine `sandbox-exec` with AgentFS when you want additional kernel-level controls like network restriction:

```sh
sandbox-exec -p '(version 1)(allow default)(deny network*)' \
    swival --sandbox agentfs "task" --yolo
```

## Base Directory Enforcement

All filesystem operations are anchored to `--base-dir`, which defaults to the current directory. Path checks resolve both the base directory and target path through symlinks, then verify that the resolved target remains inside an allowed root. If a path escapes through traversal or symlink indirection, the operation fails.

Even in YOLO mode, Swival blocks the filesystem root itself. You cannot grant the agent unrestricted access to `/` by accident.

## Additional Allowed Directories

When the agent needs full access outside `--base-dir`, pass one or more `--add-dir` flags.

```sh
swival --add-dir ~/shared-data --add-dir /opt/configs "Update the config"
```

When the agent only needs to read files without modifying them, use `--add-dir-ro` instead.

```sh
swival --add-dir-ro ~/reference-docs --add-dir-ro /opt/datasets "Analyze the data"
```

Both flags can be combined. The agent gets read-write access to `--add-dir` paths and read-only access to `--add-dir-ro` paths.

```sh
swival --add-dir ./output --add-dir-ro ~/corpus "Summarize the corpus into output/"
```

Each allowed directory must already exist, must be a directory, and cannot be the filesystem root. In REPL mode, you can grant the same access dynamically with `/add-dir <path>` or `/add-dir-ro <path>`.

## Command Execution Policy

Command execution is off by default. The agent only receives `run_command` when you explicitly enable it.

In whitelist mode, you pass a comma-separated set of command basenames.

```sh
swival --allowed-commands ls,git,python3 "task"
```

At startup, each basename is resolved to an absolute path using `which`. If a command cannot be found, Swival exits with an error. If a command resolves inside your base directory, Swival rejects it so the agent cannot modify and execute workspace binaries in one session.

At runtime in whitelist mode, commands must be passed as argument arrays, not shell strings. This removes shell interpolation and injection risk from ordinary command calls.

In YOLO mode, both the filesystem sandbox and the command whitelist are disabled. The agent can read or write any non-root path and run arbitrary commands.

```sh
swival --yolo "do whatever you want"
```

## Read-Before-Write Guard

By default, Swival blocks writes to existing files unless that file has already been read or previously written during the current session. This reduces accidental overwrites when the model has not inspected current file contents.

This guard also applies when `write_file` uses `move_from` and the destination already exists. The source path is exempt from the read requirement because renaming does not modify source content.

If you intentionally want direct write access without prior reads, disable the guard with `--no-read-guard`.

```sh
swival --no-read-guard "task"
```

## URL Fetching And SSRF Protections

The `fetch_url` tool only allows `http` and `https`. It resolves each hostname with `socket.getaddrinfo`, blocks private and internal address classes through `ipaddress`, and re-runs those checks on every redirect hop. Redirect chains are handled manually and capped at ten hops, which prevents public-to-private redirect abuse patterns.

Binary MIME types are rejected. Response bodies are capped at 5 MB before conversion, and converted inline output is capped at 50 KB.

## Output Caps

Several hard caps keep the conversation bounded. File reads are limited to 50 KB per call and lines are truncated at 2,000 characters. Directory and grep-style listings are capped at 100 results.

Command output is capped at 10 KB inline, with larger output written to `.swival/` (hard-capped at 1 MB) for paginated reads and auto-cleaned after roughly ten minutes.

MCP tool output uses higher thresholds: 20 KB inline, with larger output written to `.swival/` and hard-capped at 10 MB before writing. MCP error output is inline-capped at 20 KB without file save.

URL fetch output is capped at 50 KB inline, with larger output saved to files.

Response history is written to `.swival/HISTORY.md` until that file reaches 500 KB, after which new entries are skipped.
